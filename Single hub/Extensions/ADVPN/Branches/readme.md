# SD-WAN single hub ADVPN - Branches
------------

This configuration is to enable ADVPN on the branches. ADVPN (Auto Discovery VPN) is an IPsec technology that allows a traditional hub-and-spoke VPNâ€™s spokes to establish dynamic, on-demand, direct tunnels between each other to avoid routing through the topology's hub device.

For more details on ADVPN and SD-WAN, please see the [ADVPN and shortcut paths](link) chapter of the FortiGate admin guide.
